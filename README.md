# ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis  

This project is an implementation of **Optimization of Sentiment Analysis on Mobile Fashion Retail App Reviews** using a **Hybrid Model (NaÃ¯ve Bayes + SVM)** approach.
The pipeline includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and the creation of a **Streamlit**-based interactive application for data analysis and visualization testing.
